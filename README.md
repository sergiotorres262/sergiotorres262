### Hi ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**sergiotorres262/sergiotorres262** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

My name is Sergio and I am a student of cross-platform application development. I am proficient in languages such as Java, C#, Javascript... With a particular expertise in Java, I have worked on various projects using development environments like Eclipse, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. In addition to my programming experience, I also have knowledge in database management using MySQL. My interests include application development and big data, with a future goal of becoming a Big Data Analyst.

I have also developed a personal project using Node.js, it was a Discord bot that simulated a trading card album. The user had points that could be obtained by doing different activities like a coin flip, trivia, and betting on matches. With those points, the user could open packs and received a card. The card was added to the album that could be visualized. If the card was already owned, it was added to the duplicates deck and could be added to the market or discarded. The market allowed users to see cards added by other users and had a fixed price, if the user was interested, they could buy it directly. Unfortunately, this bot is no longer functional as it was developed for Discord version 12 and is no longer compatible.
